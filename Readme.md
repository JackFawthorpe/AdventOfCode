# An attempt to learn Rust

## About
To learn rust I chose to complete the advent of code 2023 problems in rust.

They can be found here [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/)


## Installation
You can find instructions to install rust [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Using VS code I suggest installing the rust-analyzer plugin for code completion and quick running of the project.

## Running a problem

To run a problem simply change the import from the solve import from the main.rs file to the problem to solve. Alongside this you should provide the input to the problem in input.txt at the root directory.

After that you can use 
```
cargo build
./target/debug/advent_of_code
or on windows
./target/debug/advent_of_code.exe
```
The solution to the problem will be saved within output.txt
